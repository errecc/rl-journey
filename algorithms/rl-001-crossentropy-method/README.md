# Cross Entropy Method (CEM) in Deep Reinforcement Learning

The Cross Entropy Method (CEM) is a technique used in deep reinforcement learning to optimize the expected cross entropy of a policy or state-action model. It minimizes the expected cross entropy, which measures uncertainty, by adjusting the policy or model parameters over time.

## Key Concepts

1. **Cross Entropy Function**: The CEM minimizes a loss function that is a function of the cross entropy between the current policy and the target policy (or state-action distribution).

2. **Application**: Used in algorithms like Q-learning, where the goal is to minimize the expected cross entropy of the policy to improve learning efficiency.

3. **Example**: In Q-learning, the CEM helps update the policy to reduce the expected cross entropy, leading to better policy performance.

## How It Works

- **Objective**: Minimize the expected cross entropy between the current policy and the target policy.

- **Implementation**: The CEM is typically implemented using a loss function that is a function of the cross entropy, which is minimized over time.

This method aims to balance between uncertainty and precision in policy updates, making it an effective tool for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
