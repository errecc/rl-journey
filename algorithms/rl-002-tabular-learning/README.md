# Q-Learning

## Overview
Q-Learning is a fundamental reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm where an agent learns to make decisions by maintaining a table of values for each state-action pair. It systematically explores and exploits the environment, particularly excelling in finite state and action spaces.

## Key Concepts
- **State-Action Values**: The Q-table stores the expected utility of each state-action pair.
- **Policies**: A policy determines the action probability in a given state, balancing exploration (discovery) and exploitation (use of known values).
- **Reward and Discount Factors**: Rewards from interactions update the Q-table, with future rewards discounted by a factor γ.

## Methods
### Common Algorithms
1. **Q-Learning**: Updates the Q-table based on observed rewards and next states using the Bellman equation:
   \[
   Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
   \]
   where α is the learning rate.

## Relation to Deep RL
While Q-Learning uses a table, integrating it with neural networks leads to advanced methods like DQN. However, Q-Learning's table-based approach remains foundational for simpler problems.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup**: Define the environment and state-action spaces.
2. **Initialize Table**: Set up a table to store Q-values.
3. **Interaction Loop**: Agent interacts with the environment, observing states and receiving rewards.
4. **Update Rule**: Update the Q-table using observed experiences and the Bellman equation.
5. **Policy Evaluation**: Assess policy performance periodically.

## Challenges
- **High-Dimensional State Spaces**: Struggles with large state spaces due to memory constraints.
- **Sample Inefficiency**: Requires many trials for optimal policies.
